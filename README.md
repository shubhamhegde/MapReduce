# Map-Reduce

In this project, we use the popular programming paradigm called MapReduce in parallel to solve the word counting problem. This involves reading various files to extract words and counting the number of occurrences of each word. We implement this solution using readers, mapper-combiners, and reducers as a multi-thread, multi-node solution with the use of MPI and OpenMP. We analyze the performance of our solution by comparing the results of running the parallel MapReduce as an OpenMP program on a single node, as an MPI program on multiple nodes, and as a hybrid MPI/OpenMP program. For 100 Files (67MB data), we achieved a speed-up of 4.16x (wrt serial) with OpenMP program with 8 reader threads, 8 mapper threads and 3 reducer threads. We got speed-up of 21x with hybrid MPI/OpenMP with respect to serial and 12.42x with respect to single thread for each reader, mapper and reducer configuration. We also analysed load imbalance and other system bottlenecks.
